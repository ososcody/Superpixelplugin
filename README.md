# Superpixelplugin

A plugin for _QGIS_ 3 (https://qgis.org).
- _Superpixelplugin_ calculates Superpixelsegments on multispectral raster images using several algorithms, namely _SLIC, Felzenszwalb, QuickShift_ and _Watershed_.



## Install
To run _Superpixelplugin_, the library _Scikit-image_ (https://scikit-image.org) needs to be installed to the _QGIS_ python libraries folder first.
Afterwards you can download this plugin within from within QGIS in its plugin repository or copy this code and put it in the QGIS plugin folder. 

## TODO: 
This plugin is fairly new and welcomes contributers!
I suggest the following ideas:

- [ ] Bug hunt
- [ ] Add more Superpixelalgorithms!
- [ ] Turorial / Documentation / Help / Internationalization
- [ ] Optimization of ressource efficiency (RAM etc.)
